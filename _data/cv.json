      "publisher": "NeurIPS 2025",

      "summary": "This paper is about building the World Central Banks (WCB) dataset, the largest multilingual corpus of central bank communications to date. It compiles over 380k sentences from 25 central banks across 28 years and provides expert-reviewed annotations for stance detection, temporal classification, and uncertainty estimation. The authors benchmark both pretrained and large language models across 15k+ experiments, showing that models trained on aggregated cross-bank data significantly outperform single-bank models. By combining rigorous annotation, benchmarking, and validation, the paper offers a new framework for analyzing monetary policy communications with clear economic utility."
